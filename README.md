# Color-Based-Product-Sorting-System-using-TCS3200-and-Arduino-Promini
## Overview
This project automatically sorts products based on their color using a color sensor and servo motors.

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Promini / ATmega328P
- TCS3200 Color Sensor
- Servo Motors

## Software Used
- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C

## Working Principle
The color sensor detects RGB values of the object. Based on predefined thresholds, the microcontroller rotates servo motors to sort the product.

## Applications
- Industrial automation
- Packaging systems

## Project Status
Prototype successfully tested.
